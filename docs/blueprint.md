- Accent color: Teal (#008080) to highlight key sections and call-to-action buttons.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text; this font is chosen for its modern, clean, and highly readable style suitable for on-screen use and ATS parsing.

- Use subtle transitions and animations to guide the user through the optimization process without being distracting.
